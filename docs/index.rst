   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Stellaris Stat Viewer's documentation!
=================================================

.. only:: html

    Have you ever played Stellaris and just wondered where the heck you
    stand compared to the other empires? Well, some friends of mine certainly
    have, and since Stellaris doesn't provide EU4-style ingame statistics, I
    came up with this instead. Stellaris Stat Viewer reads in a Stellaris
    savegame file and gives you copious statistics and rankings.
    
    What you are looking at now is an ongoing effort to provide a user's manual,
    as well as to document the inner workings of the program, for the benefit of
    future maintenance.
