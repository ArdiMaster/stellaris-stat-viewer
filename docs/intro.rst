Have you ever played Stellaris and just wondered where the heck you stand compared to the
other empires? Well, some friends of mine certainly have, and since Stellaris doesn't
provide EU4-style ingame statistics, I came up with this instead. Stellaris Stat Viewer
reads in a Stellaris savegame file and gives you copious statistics and rankings.

What you are looking at now is an ongoing effort to provide a user's manual, as well as to
document the inner workings of the program, for the benefit of future maintenance.
