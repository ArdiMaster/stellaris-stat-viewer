Stellaris Stat Viewer currently knows three settings, accessible via *Tools* >
*Settings* on most systems, and via *Stellaris Stat Viewer* > *Preferences* on macOS.

The **Game Folder** field allows you to input the folder in which the game itself is
installed. You can either type the path in yourself, or you can click the *Select*
button and browse for it. Setting this enables you to use the
:doc:`tech tree feature <techtree>`, and also allows displaying proper names in the
Technologies view.

The **Dot** field similarly allows you to input the location of the *dot* utility,
also used in drawing tech trees. Dot is part of `GraphViz <https://www.graphviz.org>`_.

Once you have input the game folder, the **Game Language** field will display a list
of languages found. The language chosen here will be used to display the names of
technologies both in the tech tree output and the Technologies view. Choosing *(None)*
causes SSV to display the internal identifiers used within the save files and the
game's code.
