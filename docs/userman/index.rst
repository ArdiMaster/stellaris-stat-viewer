Stellaris Stat Viewer reveals information about other empires that would not
normally be available to you during play, and its use may be considered
cheating. The author(s) of Stellaris Stat Viweer shall not be held liable for
any friendships ruined as a result of using the application.

Also, while the SSV is merely a viewer, not an editor, it *should* be safe to
use on your save files, but you may want to keep a backup just in case. Again,
the author(s) shall not be held liable for any harm caused by the use of the
application. See the license file for details about (the absence of) warranties.
